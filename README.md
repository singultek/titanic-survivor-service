# Titanic Survivor Service

### The Goal of the Project

The Titanic Survivor Service is a Python-based 
application designed to provide information about 
passengers who survived the Titanic disaster. The 
project aims to offer a simple API for predicting the 
survivors with the help of provided input data based on 
various information about the passenger such as age, sex, 
title, cabin, fare, and embankment status.

### Which Technologies I Used

**Python**: De facto standard programming language of the machine learning applications.

**FastAPI**: Utilized for building the API due to its high performance, easy-to-use 
interface, and automatic interactive documentation generation.

**pytest**: Employed for testing purposes to ensure the reliability and correctness of 
the codebase.

**Docker**: Utilized for containerization, facilitating easy deployment and reproducibility 
across different environments.

## How to Setup the Environment

### Fork the project or Copy repo on local
- Forking the project: If you intend to contribute to the project or modify it for 
your own purposes, it's recommended to fork the repository first. This creates a 
copy of the repository under your GitHub account, allowing you to freely make changes
without affecting the original project. You can fork the repository by clicking the 
"Fork" button on the GitHub repository page.
- Copy the repository locally: If you just want to use the project without contributing 
or modifying it, you can simply clone the repository to your local machine using the 
following command:
  - `git clone https://github.com/singultek/titanic-survivor-service.git`

### Create the Virtual Environment
Before running the project, it's advisable to set up a virtual environment to isolate 
its dependencies from other projects on your system. Follow these steps to create and
activate a virtual environment:

1. Navigate to the Project Directory: Open your terminal or command prompt and change 
your current directory to the project directory where you cloned or copied the repository.

`cd titanic-survivor-service
`

2. Create the Virtual Environment: Use the _python -m venv_ command to create a virtual 
environment. This command creates a folder containing all the necessary Python 
executables and libraries for the environment. 

`python -m venv venv
`

3. Activate the Virtual Environment:
   * On Windows:
   `venv\Scripts\activate`
   * On macOS and Linux:
   `source venv/bin/activate`
   
### Install Dependencies
Once the virtual environment is activated, you need to install the project 
dependencies using pip. This ensures that all the required libraries are available
within the virtual environment and don't conflict with other projects.

1. Install Model Package Requirements: Navigate to the model-package/ directory and 
install the required dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file.
- `pip install -r model-package/requirements/requirements.txt`
2. Install Titanic Survivor App Requirements: 
- `pip install -r titanic-survivor-app/requirements/requirements.txt`
3. Install the Model Package Wheel: Additionally, install the model package wheel. This wheel 
contains the necessary components for the machine learning model used by the application. 
Please be aware of the model version, and in case of any modifications on the Model Package
wheel, update the file name and reinstall the updated package. Please visit 
[Create a Model Package Wheel](#create-a-model-package-wheel-) section to get detailed 
instructions about updating the model package, and it's wheel file.
- `pip install titanic-survivor-app/requirements/titanic_classification_model-1.1.0-py3-none-any.whl`

Once you have completed these steps, the environment setup is complete, and you can proceed
to run tests, use the service, or make modifications to the project as needed.

### Create a Model Package Wheel 
If one wants to change some parts of the project and use modified model package, 
the steps below can be followed: 
- `cd model-package`
- Change the version on [VERSION](model-package/classification_model/VERSION) file 
- Create new distribution wheel with `python setup.py bdist_wheel`
- Replace the newly built wheel from `model-package/dist/titanic_classification_model-${YOUR_VERSION}-py3-none-any.whl`
to `titanic-survivor-app/requirements/titanic_classification_model-1.1.0-py3-none-any.whl`
- Go back to root directory with `cd ..`
- To avoid getting wheel from cache(This step can be skipped if it is certain that there isn't cached wheel for the 
- new version of package), uninstall the package with `pip uninstall titanic-classification-model`
- Install the new model package from the created wheel file 
with `pip install titanic-survivor-app/requirements/titanic_classification_model-${YOUR_VERSION}-py3-none-any.whl`


## How to Run Tests

Running tests ensures that the code behaves as expected and helps maintain its 
reliability and correctness. In this project, tests are organized into different 
directories corresponding to different components of the application.

1. Model Package Tests
- `pytest model-package/tests`
2. Titanic Survivor App Tests
- `pytest titanic-survivor-app/app/tests`

Running these tests will execute the test cases defined in the respective directories,
ensuring that the model package and the application components work as expected. 
If any test fails, pytest will provide detailed information about the failure, helping
identify and fix any issues in the codebase.

It's good practice to run tests regularly, especially after making changes to the code,
to catch and address any regressions or bugs early in the development process.

## How to Use the Service

The Titanic Survivor Service provides a simple API to access information about 
passengers who survived the Titanic disaster. You can interact with the service by
sending HTTP requests to its endpoints using tools like cURL, Postman, or by making 
HTTP requests from your application.

### Train Pipeline
Before using the service, you may need to train the machine learning model pipeline to 
ensure accurate predictions. Follow the below code snippet to train the pipeline:
- Train the model: `python model-package/classification_model/train_pipeline.py`

### Get Predictions
Once the model pipeline is trained, you can use the service to make predictions on new 
data or test sets. Follow these steps to get predictions:

- Predict with new data or test set: `python model-package/classification_model/predict.py`

**Important to note that**, a pipeline should be trained and saved before getting predictions. 
Inside the model package, there are some implementations to throw an error, or automatically
train a baseline pipeline when the user tries to make predictions without having 
a trained pipeline. Nonetheless, it is advised to manually train a pipeline before 
making predictions.


### Run the App
To interact with the service via its API endpoints, follow these steps to run the application:
1. Navigate to the Titanic Survivor App Directory: 
- `cd titanic-survivor-app`
2. Run the  FastAPI application using the uvicorn command:
- `uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8001`  OR
3. Directly run the app with prepared script:
- `sh ./run.sh`
- Then visit `http://localhost:8001/`

### Containerize with Docker
If you prefer to containerize the service for easy deployment, you can follow 
these steps:

1. Build the Docker Image: 
- `docker build --no-cache -t titanic-survivor-service:1.1.0 -f Dockerfile .`
    - --no-cache flag is used to have clean build, otherwise some minor changes may 
  not be executed in order to fasten the build process.
    - -t flag is useful to tag the image. In this example, out tag is same as the 
  release. If you want to create an image instance directly on your Docker Hub, you
  can modify the command as `docker build --no-cache -t ${YOUR_DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME}/
  titanic-survivor-service:1.1.0 -f Dockerfile .`. 
    - -f flag will help you to point out the docker file name you want to build from. 
  "Dockerfile" is the default value. Docker file name is followed by "." path indicator.
2. Run the Docker Container:
- `docker run -it -p 8001:8001/tcp --name container-titanic-survivor-service titanic-survivor-service:1.1.0`
  - -it flag uses the interactive terminal. 
  - -p flag is used for linking the containers port to our local machines port.
  - --name flag instantiate the container with the given name, otherwise it would be 
  assigned randomly.
  - If we build the image directly on Docker Hub, we need to give image from there. In
  this case, image name would be `${YOUR_DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME}/titanic-survivor-service:1.1.0`
3. The service will be accessible at`http://localhost:8001/`
